rationale: |
    Evangelist has a strongly religious connotation and might therefore cause offense. It is the English rendering of the Greek word *euangelistas*, which in the Christian New Testament refers to someone who spreads the faith. It is inappropriate to apply the word to someone who prefers not to be associated with the Christian faith. Conversely, the term can also cause offense to those who object to its being used in a secular (non-religious) context.
