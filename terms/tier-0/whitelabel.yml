    From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product):

    > A white-label product is a product or service produced by one company (the producer) that other companies (the marketers) rebrand to make it appear as if they had made it. The name derives from the image of a white label on the packaging that can be filled in with the marketer's trade dress. White label products are sold by retailers with their own trademark but the products themselves are manufactured by a third party.

    In this context, white refers to the most common background color of package paper. A white-label product lacks the printing, hence is fully white. This term is not based on a good/bad binary where white is represented as good or black is represented as bad and so does not promote racial bias.
