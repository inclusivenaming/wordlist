definition: "N/A"
use_context: "A feature that is deactivated or made unavailable."
recommendation: "Do not change. The terms 'disable' and 'disabled' are valid in the context of technology, such as disabling an application or a network component. In the context of talking about disabled people, however, follow the guidance around it from the AP Style Guide, the [UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-communication/inclusive-language-words-to-use-and-avoid-when-writing-about-disability), the [National Center for Disability and Journalism](https://ncdj.org/style-guide/), or other sources. In most cases, the recommendation is to use the word 'disabled' to refer to disabled people rather than alternate terms. The [National Center for Disability and Journalism](https://ncdj.org/style-guide/) recommends to specify the disability where relevant, instead of grouping all people under the general term."
